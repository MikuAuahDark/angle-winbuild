ANGLE Windows Build
=====

Why?
-----

1. No one bothered to create one.
2. I need to compile ANGLE for ARM64 for my experiment "[LÃ–VE](https://github.com/love2d/love) on Windows 10 ARM64"

Build Steps?
-----

See the GitHub action workflow file.

Binaries?
-----

This repo builds ANGLE from main branch once every week at Sunday. See the releases for binaries.
